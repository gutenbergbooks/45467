<h4>THE EVENING HOURS</h4>

<hr class="tb" />

<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
<a id="I"></a>I<br />
<br />
<br />
Tender flowers, light as the sea's foam,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Graced our garden way;</span><br />
The lapsing wind would give your hands caress<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with your hair would play.</span><br />
<br />
The shade was kind to our united steps<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That wandered soberly;</span><br />
And from the village a child's song arose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fill infinity.</span><br />
<br />
Our ponds extended in the autumn light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the guarding reed,</span><br />
And the wood's forehead showed its mobile crown<br />
To pools upon the mead.<br />
<br />
And we, who knew our hearts were murmuring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In union but one prayer,</span><br />
Thought that it was our peaceful life the eve<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Showed unveiled there.</span><br />
<br />
Supremely then you saw the sky aglow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a farewell caress;</span><br />
And long and long you looked on it with eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Filled with mute tenderness.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="II"></a>II<br />
<br />
<br />
If it be true<br />
That garden flower or meadow tree<br />
May hold still any memory<br />
Of lovers past who once looked on<br />
Their splendour or their purity,<br />
So shall our love return once more<br />
In that long hour of long regret<br />
To give the rose, or in the oak restore,<br />
Its sweetness or its strength,<br />
Ere death come yet.<br />
<br />
Thus shall it survive unconquered<br />
Within the glory that belongs to simple things,<br />
And find a joy again, in light that cleaves<br />
The sky on summer break of day,<br />
And find a joy again<br />
In the sweet rain<br />
That dwells in drops on hanging leaves.<br />
<br />
And if on some fair eve, from depths of space,<br />
Should come two lovers hand in hand,<br />
The oak, like a large and puissant wing<br />
Would reach its shadow out to where they stand,<br />
And the rose would give them of its perfumed grace.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="III"></a>III<br />
<br />
<br />
Dead is the glycin and the hawthorne flower;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now is the time when heather-bloom is seen,</span><br />
And on this so calm eve the rustling wind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brings you the fragrance of the starved Campine.</span><br />
<br />
Love and breathe them, thinking of its fate;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over that rugged soil the storm-wind lives;</span><br />
Sand and sea have made of it their prey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet of the little left, it ever gives.</span><br />
<br />
Of old, though autumn came, we dwelled with it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With plain and forest, with the storm and light,</span><br />
Until the angels of the Christmas time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Inscribed its legend with their winged flight.</span><br />
<br />
Your heart became more simple and more sure;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We loved the villagers and the forlorn</span><br />
Old women who would speak of their great age<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of old spinning-wheels their hands had worn.</span><br />
<br />
Our quiet house upon the misty heath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was frank and welcoming to all who came;</span><br />
Its roof was dear to us, its door and sill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hearth long blackened by familiar flame.</span><br />
<br />
When over vast, pale, measureless repose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The total splendour of the night was set,</span><br />
A lesson of deep silence we received,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose ardour never shall our souls forget.</span><br />
<br />
Since we were more alone amid the plain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dawn and evening entered more our thought,</span><br />
Our eyes were franker and our hearts more sweet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with the world's desire more fully fraught.</span><br />
<br />
We found content in not exacting it;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sadness, even, of the days was kind,</span><br />
And the rare sunlight of the autumn's end<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Charmed us the more that it seemed weak and blind.</span><br />
<br />
Dead is the glycin and the hawthorne flower;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now are the days when heather-bloom is seen,</span><br />
Remember these, and let the rustling wind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bring you the fragrance of the starved Campine.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="IV"></a>IV<br />
<br />
<br />
Draw your chair to mine<br />
And stretch your hands to the hearth',<br />
That I may see between your fingers<br />
Shine<br />
The ancient flame;<br />
And look upon the fire<br />
Quietly, with your eyes<br />
That have no fear of any light,<br />
So that for me they be the same,<br />
Yet franker when the blaze leaps higher<br />
Making them as from deep within you, bright.<br />
<br />
Ah, how fair still is our life and fain!<br />
When the clock strikes out its notes of gold<br />
And I approach you and as a flower hold;<br />
And a fever slow and pure,<br />
Which we will not to restrain,<br />
Leads the kiss, marvellous and sure,<br />
From hand to brow, from brow to lips again.<br />
<br />
How well I love you, O my clear beloved,<br />
Your swooning body, caressing and caressed,<br />
In whose depth of joy I almost drown.<br />
All is more dear to me, your lips, your arms close-pressed,<br />
And your kind bosom whereon my tired head<br />
After the rapture you bestow, sinks down<br />
Quietly, near your heart to find its rest.<br />
<br />
I love you still more after love's sharp pain<br />
When your goodness still more sure and motherly<br />
Brings repose to passion's ardency,<br />
And, when desire has cried aloud its will,<br />
I hear approach familiar joy again,<br />
With steps that almost silence are, it is so still.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="V"></a>V<br />
<br />
<br />
Be kind and comforting to us, oh light!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bathe our foreheads now, oh wintry ray!</span><br />
When we two issue forth this afternoon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To breathe together the last warmth of day.</span><br />
<br />
We loved you formerly with such a pride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With such a love as our two souls could lend,</span><br />
That a supreme and sweet and friendly flame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is due us now that we await the end.</span><br />
<br />
You are that which no man may forget,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From dawn that smites his arm unconquered</span><br />
To evening when you sleep within his eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your strength abolished and your splendour dead.</span><br />
<br />
Always for us you were the seen desire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spreading through all, luminous and free,</span><br />
That with impassioned ardour deep and high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seemed from our heart to seek infinity.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VI"></a>VI<br />
<br />
<br />
Alas the time of crimson phlox is past<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of proud roses brightening the gate.</span><br />
What matter? Still I love with all my heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our garden, tho' deflow'red and desolate.</span><br />
<br />
More dear than are the joyous summer noons,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My garden is that now forlornly grieves;</span><br />
Oh the last perfumes languidly exhaled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By a late flower in the lingering leaves!</span><br />
<br />
This evening I wandered in the paths<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over the plants my fervent touch to pass,</span><br />
And falling on my knees I pressed my lips<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the wet earth among the trembling grass.</span><br />
<br />
And now that it is dying and the night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has misted all the garden with its breath,</span><br />
My being that so dwells in all this ruin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall learn to die in sharing thus its death.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VII"></a>VII<br />
<br />
<br />
The evening falls, the moon is gold....<br />
<br />
Before the day is spent<br />
Go out and wander in the garden walks<br />
And pluck with gentle hands<br />
The few remaining flowers that on their stalks<br />
Are not yet sadly bent toward the mould.<br />
<br />
What matter if their foliage be wan?<br />
We still admire and love,<br />
And still their chalices are beautiful above<br />
The stems they rest upon.<br />
<br />
You wander mid the borders here and there<br />
Along a lonely path,<br />
And the flowers you bear<br />
Tremble in your hand that shudders as it takes.<br />
And now your dreamy fingers<br />
Reverently shape the sere<br />
Roses wherein autumn lingers,<br />
Weaving them with many a tear,<br />
Into a crown of pale, clear flakes.<br />
<br />
The last light dwells upon your eyes and brow<br />
And your slow steps are sad and quiet now....<br />
<br />
Slowly, at the vesper, through the gloam,<br />
With empty hands you wandered home,<br />
Leaving, upon a little humid mound,<br />
On the path that to our doorway led,<br />
The pale circlet that your fingers bound.<br />
And I knew that in our garden perished,<br />
Where winds now pass like cohorts over-head,<br />
You would give flower again for one last time,<br />
To our youth that lies upon the ground<br />
Dead....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VIII"></a>VIII<br />
<br />
<br />
When you store away in fragrant shelves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some autumn eve, the fruits of orchard trees,</span><br />
I seem to see you calmly ranging there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our old, but fresh and perfumed memories.</span><br />
<br />
And love returns for them as once they were,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wind on lips and sunlight in my eyes;</span><br />
I see the vanished moments once again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their joy, their mirth, their fevers and their cries.</span><br />
<br />
The past comes back to life with such desire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be the present with its force again,</span><br />
That half-extinct fires burn with sudden flame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My heart exults and swoons as though in pain.</span><br />
<br />
Oh fruits that glow amid the autumn shadows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jewels fallen from the summer's string</span><br />
Of gems, illumining our sombre hours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What red awakening is this you bring!</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="IX"></a>IX<br />
<br />
<br />
Fallen is the leafage from above<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That covered all the garden with its shade;</span><br />
See, between the naked boughs far off<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The village roofs to the horizon fade.</span><br />
<br />
While summer flamed its joy, neither of us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saw them clustered there so near our home;</span><br />
But to-day, with leaf and flower dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into our thinking they more often come.</span><br />
<br />
Others are living there behind those walls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And those worn thresholds with the porch above,</span><br />
Having for only friends the wind and rain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the lighted lamp to give them love.</span><br />
<br />
In the fall of eve, when fires are lit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the pauses of the clock they heed,</span><br />
Dear, as to us, the silence is to them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The thoughts within their eyes that they may read.</span><br />
<br />
Those hours of intimacy naught disturbs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of tender and profound tranquillity,</span><br />
Blessing the instant past for having been<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And finding dearer yet the one to be.</span><br />
<br />
See how they hold between their trembling hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A happiness of pain and pleasure born;</span><br />
Known to each the other's body old<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And aged eyes by the same sorrows worn.</span><br />
<br />
The flowers of their life, they love them faded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The final perfume and the beauty brief,</span><br />
And heavy memory of glory waning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wasting in time's garden, leaf by leaf.</span><br />
<br />
Deep in their warmth of human feeling hid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the winter sheltered and reduse,</span><br />
Nothing abases them or makes them pine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And plead for days they are content to lose.</span><br />
<br />
The quiet folk of those old villages,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What neighbours are they to our happiness!</span><br />
And how we find our own tears in their eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our strength and ardour in their fearlessness!</span><br />
<br />
Down there, beneath their roofs, by windowside<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or seated by the glowing fireside, thus,</span><br />
Perhaps on such a night of wind and wet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What we have thought of them they think of us.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="X"></a>X<br />
<br />
<br />
When the star-lit heaven broods above our house<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We sit in silence during many hours</span><br />
Beneath its soft intensity of light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To feel more ardent still these selves of ours.</span><br />
<br />
The silver stars are drifting on their way;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath their flame and all their glistening</span><br />
The great night is deeper and more deep;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such calm there is, the sea is listening!</span><br />
<br />
What matter if the sea itself be still,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If in this infinity so fair,</span><br />
Pregnant now with yet unvisioned power,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our beating hearts make all the silence there?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XI"></a>XI<br />
<br />
<br />
That very love which made you be for me<br />
A splendid garden wherein moving tree,<br />
Made shadow over sward and docile rose,<br />
Makes you the shelter where I now repose.<br />
<br />
There garnered are your flowers of desire,<br />
Your lucent goodness and your gentle fire;<br />
But all within a peace profound are furled<br />
Against harsh winter winds that scar the world.<br />
<br />
My happiness is warmed within your arms;<br />
Each little tender word you whisper charms<br />
My ear with as familiar a delight<br />
As in the time when lilacs blossomed white.<br />
<br />
Your clear and merry humour daily cheers<br />
And triumphs over the distress of years;<br />
And you yourself smile at the silver hairs<br />
That your lovely head so gaily wears.<br />
<br />
When to my searching kiss your head you bow,<br />
I care not for the lines that mark your brow,<br />
Nor for a vein that traces its bold line<br />
Upon your hands now safely held in mine.<br />
<br />
You fear not; and you know most certainly<br />
That nothing dies that dares love loyally,<br />
And that the flame which nourishes us so<br />
Feeds upon ruin's self that it may grow.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XII"></a>XII<br />
<br />
<br />
Those clear welcoming flowers along the wall's extent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will be no longer waiting for us at our return;</span><br />
The silken waters that prolonged till they were spent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under a pure sweet sky no longer reach and yearn.</span><br />
<br />
Of our melancholy plains the flying birds are shy;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over the marshes pale mists begin to crawl;</span><br />
Autumn, winter! Winter, autumn!&mdash;oh the cry!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the forest do you hear the dead wood fall?</span><br />
<br />
Our garden is no longer bridegroom of the light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where once we saw the phlox in glorious surge and flare;</span><br />
Gladioli, in dust, once violent, upright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lingeringly have lain them down to perish there.</span><br />
<br />
All is without strength or beauty, without fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fleeing and quailing and crumbling and passing sadly by;</span><br />
Oh, turn on me your eyes of light, for I desire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There to seek a comer of our early sky!</span><br />
<br />
It is there alone our light may still abide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The light that filled the garden once for you and me,</span><br />
Long ago, when our lily lifted its white pride<br />
And hollyhocks were an ascending ardency.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XIII"></a>XIII<br />
<br />
<br />
When the diamond grains of fresh snow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On our threshold lie,</span><br />
I hear your steps that come and go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the room near by.</span><br />
<br />
You move the clear mirror that beside<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The window stood,</span><br />
And your bunch of keys strikes the drawer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the chest of wood.</span><br />
<br />
I hear you stirring now the fire&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The live coal flares;</span><br />
And hear you place by silent walls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The silent chairs.</span><br />
<br />
I hear you wipe the dust from objects<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you pass,</span><br />
And your ring resounds against the side<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a vibrant glass.</span><br />
<br />
And happier am I still, this eve,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With your presence dear&mdash;</span><br />
To feel you close, and not to see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But always hear.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

If fate has saved us from the banal sins<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of cowardly untruth and sad pretence,</span><br />
It is because we would have no constraint<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose yoke should bend our will with violence.</span><br />
<br />
Free and sunlit on your road you fared,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Strewing with flowers of will your flowers of love;</span><br />
Pausing to sustain me when my head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bowed to the weight of doubt or fear above.</span><br />
<br />
Always you were of gesture kind and frank,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knowing my heart for you forever burned;</span><br />
For if I loved another&mdash;could it be?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Always it was to your heart I returned.</span><br />
<br />
So pure your eyes were in their weeping that<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My truth to you became my only lord;</span><br />
I spoke to you then sweet and sacred words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your sorrow and your pardon were your sword.</span><br />
<br />
I fell asleep at evening on your breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Glad with return from distance false and bleak</span><br />
To warmth of spring within us, glad within<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your open arms captivity to seek.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XV"></a>XV<br />

<br />
No, my soul has never tired of you!<br />
<br />
In the time of June you said to me:<br />
"If I thought, beloved, if I thought<br />
That my love would ever weary you,<br />
With my sad thoughts and my lonely heart,<br />
No matter where, I should depart...."<br />
<br />
And sweetly sought the kiss I gave anew.<br />
<br />
And you said again:<br />
"One loses everything, life would repay;<br />
What though it be of gold,<br />
The chain<br />
That in one harbour's ring can hold<br />
Our human ships to-day?"<br />
<br />
And sweetly wept for pain you could not say.<br />
<br />
And you said<br />
Again and yet again:<br />
"Let us separate, before we be untrue;<br />
Our life's too pure and high<br />
To draw it out from fault to fault, and drain<br />
It wearily away...." You sought to fly<br />
From me whose desperate hands strove to retain.<br />
<br />
No, my soul has never tired of you!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XVI"></a>XVI<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah, we are happy still and proud to live<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the last ray, that's seen and then is lost,</span><br />
Brightens an instant the poor flowers of rime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Engraved upon our window by the frost.</span><br />
<br />
Life leaps within us and hope sweeps us on;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our garden, though it be now old,</span><br />
Though its paths be strewn with fallen boughs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seems living, pure and dear and lit with gold.</span><br />
<br />
Something invades our blood, intrepid, bright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And urges us to incarnate again</span><br />
Immense, full summer in the fervid kiss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That desperately we give each other then.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XVII"></a>XVII<br />
<br />
<br />
Alas, must we accept the weight of years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And find us nothing more than tranquil folk</span><br />
Who give each other infantile caress<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At eve, when hearth is quick with flame and smoke?</span><br />
<br />
Our dear belongings, shall they see us then<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Creeping from the hearth to wooden chest,</span><br />
To reach the window leaning on the wall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sitting to give our tottering bodies rest?</span><br />
<br />
If such a day must then affirm our ruin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And show the torpor brain or body fears,</span><br />
In spite of this fate we shall not complain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But keep within our breasts our captive tears.</span><br />
<br />
For we shall guard these eyes of ours to watch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For morn to follow night so pitiful,</span><br />
And see the sun of dawn burn on this life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Making of earth itself a miracle.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XVIII"></a>XVIII<br />
<br />
<br />
All little facts, the things of no account,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A letter, date, an anniversary,</span><br />
A word that's spoken as on days long past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Exalt, on these long evenings, you and me.</span><br />
<br />
We solemnise, we two, these simple things<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And count and recount all these gems of ours,</span><br />
So that what is left of our high selves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May face valiantly these sombre hours.</span><br />
<br />
And we are jealous more than it is meet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of these poor, gentle, friendly memories</span><br />
Who seat themselves with us beside the fire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With winter flowers laid across thin knees.</span><br />
<br />
And the bread of happiness which once<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We did partake of, now they sit and eat;</span><br />
The bread on which our love has fed so long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That now it finds the very crumbs are sweet.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XIX"></a>XIX<br />

<br />
Come to our threshold now, oh snow,<br />
Strew thy pallid ash,<br />
Oh peaceful and slow falling snow;<br />
The linden in the garden hangs its branches low<br />
And to the sky no flights of wood-larks go.<br />
<br />
Oh snow,<br />
Who warmest and dost shield<br />
The corn that is hardly sprung<br />
With the moss, with the down<br />
Strewn on the spreading field!<br />
Silent snow, oh friendly one<br />
To houses sleeping in the morning calm,<br />
Cover our roof and brush our window-frames;<br />
Oh luminous snow, into our very soul<br />
To find a way do thou not scorn,<br />
Snow that warmest still our last of dreams<br />
Like the springing corn.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XX"></a>XX<br />
<br />
<br />
When our clear garden lifted up its flow'rs<br />
The self-accusations made by each<br />
For failure of our love, broke into speech<br />
In passionate hours;<br />
And needed pardon offered and new peace<br />
And explanations of our miseries<br />
And tears that wet our sad and truthful eyes<br />
Gave love increase.<br />
But in these months of dreary rain<br />
When all retires to earth again,<br />
When even light is fain<br />
To find its war with darkness vain,<br />
No longer are our souls so strong and proud<br />
That, rapturously, they should confess aloud.<br />
<br />
In lowered voice our sins we say,<br />
Though still in tenderness, not scorn;<br />
But 'tis at twilight now and not at morn.<br />
Sometimes we even count them, wrong by wrong,<br />
Like things that one counts over<br />
And puts away;<br />
And their folly or their hurt to cover<br />
We argue long.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXI"></a>XXI<br />
<br />
<br />
With withered hands I touch your brow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And part your hair and kiss&mdash;(as the day dies</span><br />
And you are briefly sleeping by the hearth)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath long lashes hid, your fervent eyes.</span><br />
<br />
Oh the dear tenderness of sinking day!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I think of the long years whose flight we saw,</span><br />
And suddenly your life in them appears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So perfect that my love is filled with awe.</span><br />
<br />
And as in that time when we were betrothed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ardour again is in me and has brought</span><br />
Desire to kneel and touch your beating breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With fingers that are chaste as is my thought.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXII"></a>XXII<br />
<br />
<br />
Our hearts once burned in joyous days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With love as luminous as high,</span><br />
But age to-day has made us weak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With faults we dare deny.</span><br />
<br />
Thou dost not nourish us, oh will,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By thine ardour in the strife,</span><br />
But soft benevolence alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Colours now our life.</span><br />
<br />
We near thy brink of setting, Love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And try to hide our frailty's pain</span><br />
In banal words and poor discourse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of wisdom slow and vain.</span><br />
<br />
How sad the future then would be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If when our days grow wintrier</span><br />
There flame not forth the memory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the proud souls we were.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXIII"></a>XXIII<br />
<br />
<br />
This wrinkled winter when the ruined sun<br />
Founders in the west and sinks below,<br />
I love to say your name, so grave and slow,<br />
While the clock strikes another day now done.<br />
<br />
And saying it so ravishes my voice<br />
That from my lips it sinks into my heart,<br />
And among all sweet words that there have part,<br />
Makes me the most ardently rejoice.<br />
<br />
And in the wind of dawn or evening's breath<br />
Changeless I reiterate the theme;<br />
Oh, think with what a passion, strong, supreme,<br />
Shall I pronounce it at the hour of death!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXIV"></a>XXIV<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps,<br />
On my last day,<br />
Perhaps,<br />
Across my window sill,<br />
The sunlight frail and still<br />
Will fall and for a moment stay....<br />
<br />
My hands&mdash;my hands then poor and witherèd&mdash;<br />
By its glory will be made to gold;<br />
Slowly its kiss will glide, profound and bright,<br />
For the last time upon my mouth and head;<br />
And the flowers of my eyes, pale yet bold,<br />
Before they close, shall render back its light.<br />
<br />
Sun, I loved your strength and clarity, indeed!<br />
My sweet and fiery poems at their height<br />
Have held you captive in the heart of them;<br />
Like field of wheat that surges in the might<br />
Of summer wind my words exalted you.<br />
Oh sun, who bring to birth and flower the stem,<br />
Oh immense friend, of whom our pride has need,<br />
In that so grave, imperious hour and new,<br />
When my old heart sadly endures the test,<br />
Be you still its witness and its guest!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXV"></a>XXV<br />
<br />
<br />
Clasped about my neck and harbouring my breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah your so dear hands now and their slow caress,</span><br />
When I tell you, in the evening, how my strength<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grows leaden day by day with weight of feebleness!</span><br />
<br />
You wish it not that 1 become shadow and ruin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like all those who obey the gloomy night's behests,</span><br />
Though it be with laurel in their mournful hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And glory sleeping in their hollow breasts.</span><br />
<br />
Ah how time's harsh law is softened by your love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And how your lovely dream disconsolate tears would stem;</span><br />
For the first and only time you nurse with lies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My heart that finds excuse and gives you thanks for them.</span><br />
<br />
Which, however, knows all ardour is in vain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against what is and all that must be in the strife,</span><br />
And that perhaps there is profounder happiness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To end thus in your eyes my lovely human life.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXVI"></a>XXVI<br />
<br />
<br />
When you shall close these eyes of mine to light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh kiss them long&mdash;for all that love afire</span><br />
May hope to give they shall have given you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that last look of ultimate desire.</span><br />
<br />
Beneath the moveless glow of candle light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh lean to them your face so fain and brave</span><br />
That on them be impressed this sight alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they shall keep forever in the grave.</span><br />
<br />
And may I feel, before the tomb is mine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the pure, white bed our hands that seek</span><br />
Each other once again, and near my head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Feel for the last time repose your cheek;</span><br />
<br />
And know that I shall go away with heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Burning still for you so passionately</span><br />
That even through the mute and stony earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dead themselves shall feel its ardency!</span><br />
